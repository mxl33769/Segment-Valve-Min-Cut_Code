In the .py file, there are lines of script that have the file names. Currently they are filenames for a network called wtown. \nTo use the code for other networks, the script with filenames needs to modified corresponding to the spreadsheet name. FIrst the filename with _valves_2.xlsx needs to be changed. then the one with _pipes_2.xlsx. then the one with _junctions.xlsx. then the one with pipes_start.xlsx and pipes_end.xlsx...\n\nthe files with WCU in the filename correspond to the same water network, but different scenarios. N and N-1 are labeled as such. The ones with \"scarce\" in the filename are for the same water network but less valves than N-1 and a little more than N-2. \n\nThe files with wtown in the filename correspond to a different water network. The file included in this folder is the N-valve scenario. I still need to extract the N-1 and scarce scenarios for you for this network. Just as a note: the wtown network corresponds to a real network and we aren't supposed to share the data with others for it. \nif this is at all confusing, please let me know and we can meet on teams so I can walk you through it!
